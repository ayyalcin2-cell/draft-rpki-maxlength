                 However, measurements of current RPKI deployments have found that use of the maxLength in ROAs tends to lead to security problems.

-                The forged-origin prefix or subprefix hijack involves inserting a legitimate AS (as specified in a covering ROA) as the origin AS in the AS_PATH, and can be launched against any IP prefix/subprefix that has a ROA. Consider a prefix/subprefix that has a ROA but is unused, i.e., not announced in BGP by a legitimate AS. A forged-origin hijack involving such a prefix/subprefix can propagate widely throughout the Internet. On the other hand, if the prefix/subprefix were announced by the legitimate AS, then the propagation of the forged-origin hijack is somewhat limited because of its increased AS_PATH length relative to the legitimate announcement. Of course, forged-origin hijacks are harmful in both cases but the extent of harm is greater for unannounced prefixes.

             Considerations related to ROAs and origin validation <xref target="RFC6811"/> for the case of destination-based Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering are addressed here.
-            In RTBH, highly specific prefixes (greater than /24 in IPv4 and greater than /48 in IPv6; possibly even /32 (IPv4) and /128 (IPv6)) are announced in BGP.

             These announcements are tagged with a BLACKHOLE Community <xref target="RFC7999"/>.
             It is obviously not desirable to use large maxlength or include any such highly specific prefixes in the ROAs to accommodate destination-based RTBH filtering.
             Therefore, operators SHOULD accommodate this scenario by accepting BGP announcements tagged with BLACKHOLE Community only if the following conditions are met:
-                (1) the announcement is received on a BGP session on which there is agreement to honor BLACKHOLE Community, and
-                (2) the prefix in the announcement is covered by a ROA that has an AS number matching with the AS number of the peer on that BGP session.

+                (2) the origin AS number in the announcement matches the neighbor (customer) AS number associated with the BGP session, and (3) the prefix in the announcement is subsumed by a less-specific prefix that the neighbor (customer) AS is authorized to announce per RPKI/ROA.
